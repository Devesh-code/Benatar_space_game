# Benatar_space_game

Once upon a time, in a planet there lived a species peacefully and happily. Their planet was very beautiful. They lived with their environment harmonically. It was a sustainable planet. They didn’t have any weapons. One day they were attacked by aliens and they were unable to defend themselves. The planet was bombed and destroyed. One small kid had survived the attack miraculously and had made his aim to help out other planets from such invasion of aliens. He found a spacecraft named The Banatar and from here the journey of The Banatar starts.
