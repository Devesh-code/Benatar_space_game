## The_Benatar_space_game

Once upon a time, in a planet there lived a species peacefully and happily. Their planet was very beautiful. They lived with their environment harmonically. It was a sustainable planet. They didn’t have any weapons. One day they were attacked by aliens and they were unable to defend themselves. The planet was bombed and destroyed. One small kid had survived the attack miraculously and had made his aim to help out other planets from such invasion of aliens. He found a spacecraft named The Banatar and from here the journey of The Banatar starts.

[[Back to top]](https://github.com/Devesh-code/The-Benatar-space-game#The_Benatar_space_game)

### For `Windows`

- [Download the prebuilt zip file and unzip it.](https://github.com/Devesh-code/The-Benatar-space-game/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
- Run the executable named `main` inside the extracted file.

### `Linux/Debian` based systems

#### Option 1: Download the zipped executable file

- [Download the latest zip file for linux](https://github.com/Devesh-code/The-Benatar-space-game/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
- Unzip the file

If your download was saved on the `~/Downloads` folder

Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> to open the shell if you are on `GNU/Linux` based systems and type

```bash
$ unzip ~/Downloads/main-0.0.3.Linux.zip -d ~/Desktop
$ cd ~/Desktop
$ ## navigate to the unzipped file and change the file permissions for the executable
~/Desktop $ chmod +x main
~/Desktop $ ./main
```

This will unzip the file on your `Desktop`, you can replace it with the directory of your choice

**NOTE** : If it gives you an error, you probably don't have `unzip` installed in your system.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install unzip
```
That should fix the error.
